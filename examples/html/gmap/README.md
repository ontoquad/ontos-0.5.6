Here we have an example of how OntoQuad can be used with Google Maps.

Files:
* bicycle.nt - contains all the information about the bicycle parkings in San Francisco. This file must be loaded into the OntoQuad database.
* food.nt - contains information about the food facilities in San Francisco. This file must be loaded into the OntoQuad database.
* gmap.html - web page that does all the logic. Just put address of your OnotQUad SparQL endpoint inside the `getQueryData` method and it is ready to work!
